            <title><![CDATA[When you don’t have much time]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>When you don’t have much time</h1>,<p>There are times when you just don’t have time for a 6 - 10 hour smoke. I found myself in this position this weekend, but wanted something smokey for Saturday dinner. My local butcher (Jim Davenport - Donaghadee) had some pork shoulder - bone out - and some thick pork sausages.</p>,<p>Well, it made sense to me to get some thick shoulder chops and a dozen of the large sausages.</p>,<p>The chops had a ketchup slather and a Memphis style rub</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/613f5036f93598395a6f51469b26171e/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79ab223b-99cd-44b2-a4b3-e1baa2b5aefc.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/20546d2fce98a2fc309b60021064b148/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F49be4895-51d8-4537-a950-bec3f9d8a97b.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<p>I smoked the chops over apple wood for about 90 minutes, then wrapped them for another 90 minutes. While the chops were on the rack I place the sausages underneath for about 70 minutes, turning once.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/807bf73c199e5ee7b765dca56777a4f0/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1eb9bc65-07dd-419b-b985-8374003d0c65.jpg&x=0&y=0" title="Nicely smoked sausages">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7232bd56-20c2-4606-b961-b99ac0bf1ed6.jpg" title="Chops on the plate" alt="I nearly forgot to take a picture before this disappeared.">]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Beef Burgers]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Beef Burgers</h1>,<p>Beef burgers are a staple of most BBQs where ever you are. In theory they should be quite simple, however, depending on whether it is shop bought or homemade there can be vast differences in the quality of the burger.</p>,<p>The only way to guarantee a quality burger is to make your own from a basic meat mix. My personal favourite meat mix is 50%Brisket and 50% Beef Neck. You can ask your butcher to mince this for you, but I prefer mincing mine at home.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8a15f30f-4c8e-4064-be80-447f82c26a8a.jpg" title="Beef brisket and neck mix" alt="A mix of beef and brisket chopped into cubes ready for mincing">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b4825a1-bb56-4e2c-b822-97e7c2277aa8.jpg" title="The finished product" alt="The beef brisket and neck formed into 1/2 pound burgers">,<p>Even better is a homemade burger bun. There is a fashion nowadays for the more upmarket burger bars to use a Brioche Bun as the burger bun. Nice idea, however they do soak up the juice from your burger and fall apart.</p>,<p>A good quality burger bun doesn’t soak up the juice quite as fast and generally holds together while you eat your burger.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a333d7b7-535b-4d38-afff-a6e340c769b3.jpg" title="Burger buns cooling down" alt="So, they don&apos;t look as perfect as a shop brought bun, however, they taste great and hold together very well.">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/460b8e9e-6490-490f-a9b5-16656af01c0e.jpg" title="The finished bun with burger and salad" alt="A burger just the way I like it.
