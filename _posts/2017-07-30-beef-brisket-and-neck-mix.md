# Beef Burgers

Beef burgers are a staple of most BBQs where ever you are. In theory they should be quite simple, however, depending on whether it is shop bought or homemade there can be vast differences in the quality of the burger.

The only way to guarantee a quality burger is to make your own from a basic meat mix. My personal favourite meat mix is 50%Brisket and 50% Beef Neck. You can ask your butcher to mince this for you, but I prefer mincing mine at home.

Even better is a homemade burger bun. There is a fashion nowadays for the more upmarket burger bars to use a Brioche Bun as the burger bun. Nice idea, however they do soak up the juice from your burger and fall apart.

A good quality burger bun doesn't soak up the juice quite as fast and generally holds together while you eat your burger.
