# When you don't have much time

There are times when you just don't have time for a 6 - 10 hour smoke. I found myself in this position this weekend, but wanted something smokey for Saturday dinner. My local butcher (Jim Davenport - Donaghadee) had some pork shoulder - bone out - and some thick pork sausages.

Well, it made sense to me to get some thick shoulder chops and a dozen of the large sausages.

The chops had a ketchup slather and a Memphis style rub

I smoked the chops over apple wood for about 90 minutes, then wrapped them for another 90 minutes. While the chops were on the rack I place the sausages underneath for about 70 minutes, turning once.
